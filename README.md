Pumpkin Seeds Classification using Ensemble Machine Learning & MRMR
This project presents an Innovative Ensemble Machine Learning Framework for Pumpkin Seed Classification using Forward Sequential MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) feature engineering.

 Project Overview
We classified pumpkin seeds of two varieties: ✅ Ürgüp Sivrisi ✅ Çerçevelik

The goal was to boost accuracy and performance using ensemble learning models combined with feature selection.
Data Split:

70% → Training
10% → Hold-out Validation
20% → Testing
 Feature Selection:

Applied MRMR to select top relevant features
Found that 8 features are optimal (accuracy drops after 6, so 8 is the sweet spot)
3️⃣ Model Training & Testing:

Trained multiple ensemble models
Compared performance using evaluation metrics
4️⃣ Best Model: ⭐ Optimizable Ensemble achieved the highest accuracy
Techniques Used
Feature Engineering: MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance)

Classifiers: ✅ Boosted Trees ✅ Bagged Trees ✅ RUS Boosted Trees ✅ Optimizable Ensemble

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Samples: 2,500 pumpkin seeds

Features: 13 (e.g., Area, Perimeter, Solidity, Aspect Ratio)

Classes:

52% Çerçevelik
48% Ürgüp Sivrisi
